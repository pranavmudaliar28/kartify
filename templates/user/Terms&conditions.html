    <p>The terms and conditions of sale as set out herein (&ldquo;<strong>Terms of Sale</strong>&rdquo;) constitute an
        agreement between us and you and govern the terms and conditions on which you purchase your Products from us on
        or through the platform. By placing an order for any Product with us or making a purchase of Product, you
        expressly agree to be bound by these Terms of Sale.</p>
    <p>These Terms of Sale are in addition to the Agreement. These Terms of Sale constitute an electronic record within
        the meaning of the applicable law. This electronic record is generated by a computer system and does not require
        any physical or digital signatures.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>OUR CONTRACT OF SALE </strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listing and display of a Product by us on Kartify
        Platform is our invitation to you to make an offer for purchase of such Product. Likewise, the placement of an
        order on Kartify Platform by you is your offer to buy the Product(s) from us.</p>
    <p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have placed an order with us for purchase of
        a Product, you will receive an e-mail and/or mobile confirming receipt of your order and containing the details
        of your order (the &ldquo;<strong>Order Confirmation</strong>&rdquo;). The Order Confirmation is merely an
        acknowledgement that we have received your order and does not signify our acceptance of your offer.</p>
    <p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We only accept your offer and conclude the contract of
        sale for a Product ordered by you, when the Product is shipped or dispatched to you and an e-mail and/or
        registered mobile number confirmation is sent to you that the Product has been shipped or dispatched to you (the
        &ldquo;<strong>Shipment Confirmation</strong>&rdquo;). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse
        or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever before sending Shipment Confirmation to you.</p>
    <p>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your order is dispatched in more than one package,
        you may receive separate Shipment Confirmations for each package, and each Shipment Confirmation and
        corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the Product(s) specified
        in that Shipment Confirmation.</p>
    <p>1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any communication from us shall be sent only to your
        registered mobile number and/or email address or such other contact number or email address that you may
        designate, for any particular transaction. You shall be solely responsible to update your registered mobile
        number and/or email address on the Kartify Platform in the event there is a change. Further, we may also send
        you notifications and reminders with respect to scheduled deliveries of the purchased Products. While we shall
        make every endeavour to share prompt reminders and notifications relating to the delivery of purchased
        Product(s) with you, we shall not be held liable for any failure to send such notifications or reminders to
        you.</p>
    <p>1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your contract is with us and you confirm that the
        Product(s) ordered by you are purchased for your personal purpose and not for re-sale or business purpose.
        Please note that we sell Products only in quantities which correspond to the usual requirements of an average
        household. This applies both to the number of Products ordered within a single order and the placing of several
        orders for the same Product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household.</p>
    <p>1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All orders placed on Kartify Platform are subject to
        the availability of such Product, our acceptance of your offer as per the above and your continued adherence to
        these Terms of Sale.</p>
    <p>1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You hereby authorise us to declare and provide

        Please note that this price may differ from the price shown for the Product when you first placed it in your

        possible that a Product&rsquo;s price may decrease between the time you place it in your shopping cart and the
        time you place the order. The prices mentioned at the time of ordering will be the prices charged on the date of

    <p>In no event, our aggregate liability, if any, that is proven and ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction
        pursuant to a claim by you or person acting on your behalf, shall extend beyond the money charged from you for
        purchases made pursuant to an order under which such liability has arisen and been established. We will not be
        responsible for any business loss (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts, anticipated savings, data,
        goodwill or wasted expenditure) or any other indirect or consequential loss that is not reasonably foreseeable
        to both you and us when a contract for the sale of Product by us to you was formed.</p>

        apply to orders previously placed by you). If any of these conditions is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason
